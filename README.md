## My process

I used mobile first workflow while building this project. Then I added/modified styles for the desktop version. Finally, I added some javascript code block for the desktop version, I used DOM for these things.

### Built with

Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Flexbox
Mobile-first workflow
JavaScript
DOM

### What I learned

After creating many HTML/CSS projects, this is my eighth project built with the DOM. Therefore, I can confidently say that I am now completely familiar with the DOM structure and its basics. I plan to continue working on projects involving the DOM to deepen my understanding.


### Continued development

Already, after building a lot of DOM projects, I am going to commence learning React JS.
