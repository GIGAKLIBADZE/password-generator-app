## My process

I used mobile first workflow while building this project. Then I added/modified styles for the desktop version. Finally, I added some javascript code block for the desktop version, I used DOM for these things.

### Built with

Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Flexbox
Mobile-first workflow
JavaScript
DOM

### What I learned

After creating many HTML/CSS projects, this is my seventh project built with the DOM. Therefore, I can confidently say that I am now completely familiar with the DOM structure and its basics. I plan to continue working on projects involving the DOM to deepen my understanding.

Additionaly, I never used HTML input tag with porperty of checkbox. Now, I am familliar with this. I used some manipulations on this from DOM also.

### Continued development

Now, after building some markup projects, I am going to continue learn how to use JavaScript in web projects with DOM. Then I will continue constructing more complex projects by using my new knowledge.
